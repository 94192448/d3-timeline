#d3-timeline
A simple d3 timeline plugin.

Get something that looks like
![Rectangular Timeline](https://raw.github.com/jiahuang/d3-timeline/master/examples/timeline1.png)

Works with circles. In case the rectangular edges are too pointy.

)

And a pesudo-gantt chart thingy

)

It can even do things on hover and click. For when someone accidentally mouses over your chart.
